1. Semantic and Descriptive Button Titles:

  Added descriptive titles to buttons across the application (e.g., "Click to go back," "Edit this question," "Click to delete this question"), facilitating easier navigation and better screen reader support.

2. Semantic Icon Usage:

  Designed buttons with semantic icons (edit, delete, play, copy, end session) clearly representing their functionality, enhancing clarity for users relying on visual cues and screen readers.

3. Enhanced Hover Interactivity:

  Implemented rich and consistent hover effects (color changes, scaling animations, show usage) for interactive elements, providing clear visual feedback and improving usability for all users.

4. ARIA Attributes:

  Integrated aria-label attributes on critical interactive elements (e.g., "Control-center," "answers," "question-describe") ensuring better contextual understanding for users relying on assistive technology.

5. Overflow Handling with Tooltips:

  On the "Edit Questions" page (EditGame.jsx), added title attributes to question text elements. This ensures that when the viewport is too narrow, users can hover to reveal the full question text, maintaining clarity and readability.

6. Form Accessibility:

  Enhanced forms by using clearly labeled input fields (e.g., name, email, password, confirm password) with semantic labels explicitly linked to inputs, improving screen reader compatibility and ease of use.

7. Error Messaging Accessibility:

  Improved form validation and error handling by clearly displaying accessible, descriptive error messages, including visually distinctive and semantically meaningful feedback for incorrect inputs.

8. Keyboard Navigation:

  Ensured all interactive components and forms support keyboard navigation, allowing users who do not or cannot use a mouse to fully interact with the application.
