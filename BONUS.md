1. Lobby Room

Description: While players wait for the admin to start the game session, they see a custom lobby screen instead of a static “Please wait” message. It features a centered spinner animation and a friendly welcome message to keep the waiting experience engaging.

2. Title Tooltips for Overflow Text

Description: On the Edit Game and Dashboard screens, long game or question titles that might overflow their containers now display the full text on hover via the title attribute. This ensures no information is hidden, especially on narrow or mobile views.

3. Dynamic Button Animations

Description: Interactive buttons (Play, Stop, Submit, Add Answer) have subtle scale and color-change animations on hover/focus. These animations are implemented with Tailwind’s transition utilities and custom CSS variables.

4. Responsive Accessibility Controls

Description: Added aria-label attributes to all icon buttons (Play, Stop, Copy, Back) and ensured all interactive elements have keyboard focus styles. This elevates the accessibility compliance beyond the basic spec.
